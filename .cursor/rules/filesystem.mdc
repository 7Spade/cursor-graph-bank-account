# Filesystem MCP Server Rules
Configuration for AI behavior when interacting with Filesystem MCP Server

## CRITICAL: File System Security
- ALWAYS verify file paths before performing operations
- NEVER allow access to system directories outside the workspace
- Use relative paths when possible, absolute paths only when necessary
- Validate file extensions and types before operations

## File Operations Best Practices
- Before creating files, check if they already exist to avoid overwriting
- When reading files, handle encoding issues gracefully (UTF-8 preferred)
- For large files, consider streaming or chunked reading
- Always close file handles after operations

## Directory Operations
- When listing directories, respect hidden files (.gitignore, .env, etc.)
- Use recursive operations carefully to avoid infinite loops
- Validate directory permissions before operations
- Handle symbolic links appropriately

## Error Handling
- If file operations fail, provide clear error messages
- Suggest alternative approaches when operations are blocked
- Handle permission denied errors gracefully
- Check disk space before large file operations

## Security Considerations
- Never expose sensitive file contents (passwords, keys, tokens)
- Validate file paths to prevent directory traversal attacks
- Be cautious with executable files and scripts
- Respect file system permissions and ownership

## Performance Guidelines
- Use efficient file operations for large datasets
- Consider file locking for concurrent access
- Optimize directory traversal for large folder structures
- Cache frequently accessed file metadata when appropriate

## Integration with Other Tools
- When files are modified, notify relevant MCP servers (like Codacy for analysis)
- Coordinate with version control systems when applicable
- Maintain consistency with project structure and conventions
- Document file changes in appropriate logs or tracking systems
